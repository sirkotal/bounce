To play the game, in addition to the game's source code, you must have [SICStus Prolog 4.8](https://sicstus.sics.se/download4.html) currently installed on your computer. 

On the SICStus interpreter, consult the *main.pl* file, located in the game's folder:

```?- consult('main.pl').```

***Note:*** *If you're on Windows, you can also do this by selecting the `File` → `Consult...` options on the SICStus terminal and selecting **main.pl**.*
    
To start the game and enter the main menu, run the `play/0` predicate:

```?- play.```
